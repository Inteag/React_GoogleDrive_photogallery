# What the project does
this project was created to display images obtained from the Google Drive cloud storage and to receive Instagram posts. A lot of elements may not work correctly since I'm just learning React.


# What you need to work with the app
to work with the app, you need to install the app.
## installing a dependency
   Npm -i 
## create an env file
add the REACT_APP_INS_TOKEN token and the REACT_APP_GOOGLE_TOKEN_GALLERY token
React_APP_INS  it is a token from the social network Instagram
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_TOKEN_GALLERY it is a Google Drive token

the program has flaws but the main idea of displaying images and posts is implemented.
